In this study, the authors compared the gene expression in histologically normal bronchial epithelium in 79 samples from smokers with lung cancer with 73 samples from smokers without lung cancer.

    "Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) is an enzyme that is a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. MAPK6, along with other MAP kinases, are extracellular signal-regulated kinases, which are activated through protein phosphorylation. MAPK6 is known to contain one protein kinase domain (Pkinase), located at the N-terminus. This Pkinase domain is a linear motif binding (LMB) domain, and is known to bind the following short linear motifs (SLiMs):\n",
